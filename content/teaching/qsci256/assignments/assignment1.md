## Instructions

1. Read DCIC section ยง3.1 & ยง3.2: <https://dcic-world.org/2023-02-21/getting-started.html>. The main ideas (and what I'll cover if we meet up) are:
	- setting up Pyret
	- types (numbers, strings, images) & values
	- operations & expressions
	- definitions (i.e. naming values)

2. Go to <https://code.pyret.org/> in a browser and create a Pyret file called `exploring.arr`. Spend a little time familiarizing yourself with the interface, following along with the textbook and exploring.


3. When you're ready, create a new Pyret file called `flags.arr`. Add a series of expressions to your file such that, when the file is Run, the following flags appear in order in the interactions area:
	
	- Vietnam
	- Chile
	- Suriname
	- Turkey
	- (optional) Saint Lucia

	Create these flag images using the Pyret image primitives (`rectangle`, `star`, etc.), and the image manipulation functions (`overlay`, `above`, etc.). You should use a web search to figure out what the flags look like. You will need to read the Pyret Image Documentation to find "other functions" to make the Turkey and Saint Lucia flags.
	
	The flags should have width of at least 100, but not be so large that you need to scroll a lot to see them all. They don't need to be exactly right or match the colors perfectly (but you're welcome to spend as much time as you like making them more accurate).


4. Download your `flags.arr` file and email it to me in a reply to the week 1 email.
