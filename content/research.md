## Dissertation

My dissertation research is focused on general patterns in mobility and its applications for epidemiology, ecology, and sociology.

The first chapter of my dissertation applies patterns in movement to epidemiology, to model diseases that spread in high-risk locations such as bars and restaurants and contributing to the literature on super spreading events.

My second chapter investigates animal transportation networks and a class of models called "active walkers" - agents which move through a 2-dimensional space and modify the path they walk on to leave a trail which makes it beneficial for other agents to walk along the same path.

My third and fourth chapters adapt and expand upon the approach taken in [_The scales of human mobility_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2909-1), applying the approach to animals and investigating anthropological invariants related to daily travel budgets/time.
