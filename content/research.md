## Dissertation

My dissertation research is focused on general patterns in mobility and its applications for epidemiology, ecology, and sociology.

I apply patterns in mobility to model diseases that spread in high-risk locations.

I investigate emergent animal transportation networks and a class of models called "active walkers" - agents which move through a 2-dimensional space and modify the path they walk on to leave a trail which makes it attractive for others to walk the same way.

I'm working to expand upon the approach taken in [_The scales of human mobility_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2909-1), to look for scales in animal mobility, and to investigate anthropological invariants.
