### On land use and transportation

Something can be a "road": fast and good at getting between places. Or it can be a "street": nice for for spending time, accessing homes and stores. In the US, we too frequently build "stroads" that try to do both and succeed at neither: [_Stroads_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM&list=PLJp5q-R0lZ0_FCUbeVWK6OGLN69ehUTVa&index=6) by Not Just Bikes.

We build too much parking ([_The trouble with minimum parking requirements_](http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/Trouble.pdf) by Donald C. Shoup), and don't allow cities to develop organically ([_This Experiment Undid our Cities_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1G_bda3o1o&t=227s) by Strong Towns). This deprives us of our public spaces, restricts our ability to [hang out](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-sheila-liming.html), and makes us lonelier ([_Barcelona Superblocks_](https://sites.libsyn.com/132228/twoc-bonus-barcelonas-superblocks-with-david-roberts-of-vox) by The War on Cars with David Roberts).


### On teaching & learning

We take the joy out of learning: [_The Case Against Grades_](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/) by Alfie Kohn or [_A Mathematician's Lament_](https://worrydream.com/refs/Lockhart_2002_-_A_Mathematician%27s_Lament.pdf) by Paul Lockhart.

We should teach elegant languages to new programmers: [_To the members of the Budget Council_](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/OtherDocs/Haskell.html) by Edsger W. Dijkstra.

Why are some people better at things than others? To be excellent, you don't need to practice _more_ than the competition; simply obsess about perfecting every aspect of what you're doing: [_The Mundanity of Excellence_](https://academics.hamilton.edu/documents/themundanityofexcellence.pdf) by Daniel F. Chambliss


### On "the tech" (i.e. how to interact with people / how people think)

You have two minds: the slow one you're conscious of, and the fast one that operates unconsciously. [_Thinking, Fast and Slow_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) by Daniel Kahneman for the long version, or [_Blink_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink:_The_Power_of_Thinking_Without_Thinking) by Malcom Gladwell for the short version.

Treat your partner like you're an exotic animal trainer and they're an exotic animal: [_What Shamu taught me about a happy marriage_](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/style/modern-love-what-shamu-taught-me-happy-marriage.html) by Amy Sutherland. (This is actually imperative to master if you want to succeed in coaching youth ultimate.)

Human values take on a consistent form across cultures and times; the thing that differs is the order in which someone prioritize them (which is very useful to know about them): [_An Overview of the Schwartz Theory of Basic Human Values_](https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&context=orpc) by Shalom H. Schwartz
