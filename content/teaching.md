## Teaching experience

I've served as a teaching assistant for math, computer science and ecology classes as an undergraduate at Brown University and as a MS and PhD student at University of Washington, including:



- QSCI 292 - Integral Calculus at UW in which I wrote the homework assignments,  co-wrote exams, and delivered two weeks' lectures.

- QSCI 454 - Graduate level Quantitative Ecology at UW

- CSE 403 & CSE 503 - Undergraduate & Graduate level Software Engineering at UW

- Math 124 & 125 - Calculus 1 and 2 at UW

- CS 17 - Integrated Introduction to Computer Science at Brown University, in which I helped write assignments and develop grading rubrics.


## Advanced Calculus assignments

I wrote a series of 5 optional "advanced" homework assignments for introductory Calculus II QSCI 292 at UW. Here's the introduction to the first of them:

> _This is the first in a series of 5 "advanced" homework assignments that explore taylor series, the number $e$, imaginary numbers, and finally euler's equation for $e^{i x}$. These ideas are some of the most beautiful and profound ones in all of mathematics; they run through and tie together everything else we do in calculus._

> _These assignments test a theory I have: that while we cordone some topics off as "too advanced", they're actually not that hard to start to learn with a gentle introduction; and they're worth the effort.
> More practically, everyone comes to a class from a different starting place, and with a different learning style.
> These assignments give you an option to customize your experience: in exchange for doing a little more work you'll learn more (and maybe in a way that works better for you), and you'll have more control over your schedule and pacing for the quarter._
