### Land use and transportation

- [_Stroads_ by _Not Just Bikes_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM&list=PLJp5q-R0lZ0_FCUbeVWK6OGLN69ehUTVa&index=6). Something can be a _road_ – fast way to get between places -- or a _street_ – comfortable, human-scale for _accessing_ places. Build something to be both and it succeeds at neither.
- [_The trouble with minimum parking requirements_ by Donald C. Shoup](http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/Trouble.pdf)
