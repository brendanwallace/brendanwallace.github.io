Hi! I'm a PhD student at the [University of Washington (UW)](https://www.washington.edu/) in the [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM) program](https://quantitative.uw.edu/graduate/qerm/), part of the [Complex Ecological Systems Lab](https://complexecolab.github.io/).
I'm interested in complex systems, network science, and general patterns in movement in animals and people.
Before UW, I modeled road traffic for Google maps.

I think a lot about teaching and learning: there are some great teachers out there but I think we regularly get a lot of things wrong.
I have strong opinions about programming and teaching programming.
I coach Ultimate frisbee for Lakeside school and play for (and founded) [Switchback ultimate](https://switchbackultimate.com/).
I like to talk about how cars ruin cities, and how we'd be much better off if we prioritized density, walking, biking and transit instead.
