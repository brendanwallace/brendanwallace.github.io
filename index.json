[{"content":"Hi! I\u0026rsquo;m a PhD student at the University of Washington (UW) in the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM) program, part of the Complex Ecological Systems Lab. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in complex systems, network science, and general patterns in movement in animals and people. Before UW, I used to work on traffic modeling for Google maps.\nI think a lot about teaching and learning: there are some great teachers out there but I think we regularly get a lot of things wrong. Relatedly, I have strong opinions about programming and teaching programming. I coach Ultimate frisbee for Lakeside school and play for Switchback ultimate. I like to talk about how cars ruin cities, and how we\u0026rsquo;d be much better off if we prioritized density, walking, and transit.\n","date":"April 16 2024","permalink":"/","section":"About me","summary":"Hi!

Here\u0026rsquo;s the introduction to the first of them:\nThis is the first in a series of 5 \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; homework assignments that explore taylor series, the number $e$, imaginary numbers, and finally euler\u0026rsquo;s equation for $e^{i x}$. These ideas are some of the most beautiful and profound ones in all of mathematics; they run through and tie together everything else we do in calculus.\nThese assignments test a theory I have: that while we cordone some topics off as \u0026ldquo;too advanced\u0026rdquo;, they\u0026rsquo;re actually not that hard to start to learn with a gentle introduction; and they\u0026rsquo;re worth the effort. More practically, everyone comes to a class from a different starting place, and with a different learning style. These assignments give you an option to customize your experience: in exchange for doing a little more work you\u0026rsquo;ll learn more (and maybe in a way that works better for you), and you\u0026rsquo;ll have more control over your schedule and pacing for the quarter.\nIf you want to check them out they\u0026rsquo;re available here: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5\n","date":"January 1 0001","permalink":"/teaching/","section":"About me","summary":"Teaching experience # I\u0026rsquo;ve served as a teaching assistant for math, computer science and ecology classes as an undergraduate at Brown University and as a MS and PhD student at University of Washington, including:","title":"Teaching"},{"content":"","date":"January 1 0001","permalink":"/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"}]
