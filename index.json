The list empty is just that: a list with nothing in it. A list made with link(first, rest) contains two parts: first is any value (a number, string, boolean, etc) and rest is a list.\nSo for example, a list of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in Pyret is written as,\nlink(1, link(2, link(3, empty))).\n(The textbook introduces a shorthand way to write lists that looks like `[list: 1, 2, 3], which we will use in the future but you should ignore for now.)\nGiven a list, you can process it using a cases expression:\ncases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; [ expression 1 ] | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; [ expression 2 ] end If the list l is the empty list, the outer expression will evaluate to expression 1. If l is not the empty list, the cases expression will evaluate to expression 2, in which the values f and r are available.\nSo for example, the following expression will evaluate to one of two strings depending on whether l is empty.\ncases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; \u0026quot;this list is empty\u0026quot; | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; \u0026quot;this list is not empty\u0026quot; end To deal with the recursive nature of lists (a list which is not empty contains another list), you can use function recursion by calling a function from within that function itself.\nFor example, the following function will compute the length of a list.\nfun my-len(l :: List) -\u0026gt; Number: cases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; 0 | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; 1 + my-len(r) end end If we called this function on our example list link(1, link(2, link(3, empty))) the evaluation would proceed like this:\nmy-len(link(1, link(2, link(3, empty)))) =\u0026gt; 1 + my-len(link(2, link(3, empty))) =\u0026gt; 1 + 1 + my-len(link(3, empty)) =\u0026gt; 1 + 1 + 1 + my-len(empty) =\u0026gt; 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 =\u0026gt; 3 List problems # Create a file called lists.arr.\nWrite function my-sum that takes as input a list of numbers and evaluates to the sum of the numbers of the list. 1.5 Write a function my-multiply that multiplies together all the numbers in a list. (Hint: what should my-multiply produce for an empty list?)\nWrite function exclaim that takes a list of strings, and adds \u0026ldquo;!\u0026rdquo; to the end of them. (To concatenate two strings together, use the + operator. For example, \u0026quot;hi\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;!\u0026quot; evaluates to \u0026quot;hi!\u0026quot;.)\nWrite function first-n that takes a list l and a number n, and evaluates to a list made of only the first n elements of l (or the whole list l if n is greater than the length of l.)\nWrite function insert-nth that takes a list l, a number n and a value e, and evaluates to the list l with element e inserted after the first n elements (or at the end, if there are fewer than n elements in l).\nWrite function find-element that takes a list l and an element e that is in l, and evaluates to the first position at which e occurs in the list l. For example, find-element(link(1, link(2, link(3, empty))), 2) = 1. If the element doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the list, you may return whatever value you\u0026rsquo;d like or raise an error.\nHint: you may want to write a helper function with an acculumating index.\nTurn in # Make sure that all your functions include a docstring and a sufficient number of test cases.\nDownload your files tables.arr and lists.arr and email them to me.\n","date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"/teaching/qsci256/assignments/assignment3/","section":"Teaching","summary":"Tables # Read §4.1 in DCIC.\nTable Problems # Create a file called tables.arr.\nInclude the following table definitions (from the textbook) in your definitions panel:\npeople = table: name, age row: \u0026quot;Alicia\u0026quot;, 30 row: \u0026quot;Meihui\u0026quot;, 40 row: \u0026quot;Jamal\u0026quot;, 25 end shuttle = table: month, riders row: \u0026quot;Jan\u0026quot;, 1123 row: \u0026quot;Feb\u0026quot;, 1045 row: \u0026quot;Mar\u0026quot;, 1087 row: \u0026quot;Apr\u0026quot;, 999 end Write function is-winter that takes a Row r with a \u0026ldquo;month\u0026rdquo; column as input and produces a Boolean indicating whether the month in that row is one of \u0026ldquo;Jan\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Feb\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Mar\u0026rdquo;.","title":"Assignment 3 - Tables \u0026 Lists"},{"content":"This assignment departs from the textbook, so there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to read. I think this content is really cool, but it might be too hard to include in the actual class. And it may especially be too hard for you all since I can\u0026rsquo;t do a lecture! If so, feel free to skip or just let me know.\nFrom now on, you may use the following syntactic sugar for lists that you already saw in the textbook:\n[list: 1, 2, 3] = link(1, link(2, link(3, empty))) (Pyret converts the former into the latter before running it, so it\u0026rsquo;s just for ease of writing examples and tests.)\n[list: ] = empty as well.\nHigher-order functions # Create a file called higher-order-functions.arr.\nMap # Recall the function (from the textbook) to double every number in a list:\nfun my-doubles(l): cases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; empty | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; link(2 * f, my-doubles(l)) end end This bears a striking resemblence to the function you wrote to add an exclamation mark to every string in a list:\nfun exclaim(l): cases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; empty | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; link(f + \u0026quot;!\u0026quot;, exclaim(l)) end end In both cases, we recur through a list and apply some function to each element in the list.\nFortunately, we can write what\u0026rsquo;s called a higher-order function: a function that takes another function as one of its arguments! This works just the same as passing any other argument to the function.\nWrite the higher-order function my-map that takes as input a list l and a function func, and produces a list made from applying func to every element in l. (This is called mapping the function func across the list l.) Start with: fun my-map(func, l): ... end Within the body of the function, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to call func like any other function.\nRewrite my-doubles and exclaim using my-map. You will need to write helper functions to use as func in each case. (That is, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to write a function double-one and exclaim-one that double a single number, and add an exclamation point to a single string, respectively.)\nYou do not need to directly test my-map: the examples you write for my-doubles and exclaim suffice to test it.\nAnonymous functions # Writing helper functions to use as inputs for my-doubles makes using high-order functions more verbose. Fortunately, we can create functions anonymously to use as arguments to our higher-order functions.\nAn anonymous function looks like this:\nlam(x): x + 1 end or\nlam(x, y): x + y end The lam is short for \u0026ldquo;lambda\u0026rdquo;, as in lambda calculus. (If you look closely at the Pyret mascot you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to spot a lambda symbol: λ.)\nOptional: refactor my-doubles and exclaim from (2.) using anonymous functions.\nFor example, to add 1 to every element in a list:\nmy-map(lam(x): x + 1 end, [list: 1, 2, 3]) =\u0026gt; [list: 2, 3, 4] Fold # Now consider the function my-sum, which adds up all the numbers in a list:\nfun my-sum(l): cases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; 0 | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; f + my-sum(r) end end We could write a similar function, my-multiply, to multiply together all the numbers in a list:\nfun my-multiply(l): cases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; 1 | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; f * my-multiply(r) end end Let\u0026rsquo;s think about what\u0026rsquo;s going on in these functions.\nEach function returns some specific value if it sees an empty list. Otherwise, it has a way to combine an element from the list with the result of the recursive call on the rest of the list.\nIn short, the body of each function looks like this:\ncases (List) l: | empty =\u0026gt; [base case] | link(f, r) =\u0026gt; [do something with f and the recursive call on r] end This recursive combination is called a fold.\nWrite the higher-order function my-fold that takes as input a two-argument \u0026ldquo;combining\u0026rdquo; function func, a value base-value and a list l. If l is empty, my-fold evaluates to base-value, otherwise my-fold produces a new value by repeatedly applying func.\nUse my-fold to rewrite my-length (finds the length of a list), my-sum and my-multiply. You may use anonymous functions or helper functions.\nmap and fold are built in to Pyret, and after you implement them yourself you are free to use the built-in versions for future problems and assignments.\nHarder list functions # Create a file called lists2.arr\nWrite a function my-reverse that consumes a list l and produces a new list with the same elements in reverse order.\nWrite a function my-concat that consumes two lists l-1 and l-2, and produces a list with all the elements from l-1 followed by all the elements from l-2.\nAfter you implement my-reverse you are welcome to use the built in reverse. After you implement my-concat, you can concatenate lists in Pyret by using the + operator, for example,\n[list: 1, 2, 3] + [list: 4, 5] =\u0026gt; [list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Optional challenge: Write a function subsets that consumes a list l, and produces a list of lists where each list contains the elements of a single subset of l. For example, subsets should produce the following (subject to reordering):\nsubsets([list: ]) =\u0026gt; [list: [list: ]] subsets([list: 1]) =\u0026gt; [list: [list: 1], [list: ]] subsets([list: 1, 2]) =\u0026gt; [list: [list: 1, 2], [list: 1], [list: 2], [list: ]] This problem is notoriously tough, scroll all the way down if you\u0026rsquo;d like any hints.\nTurn in # Download higher-order-functions.arr and lists2.arr and submit them to gradescope.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nSubset hint. 1 # Lets think about the list [list: 1, 2] and its 4 subsets:\n[list: 1, 2], [list: 1], [list: 2], [list: ] or\n{1, 2}, {1}, {2}, {} The subsets are made by considering each element of the original list, and either including it or not including it in the subset.

Hot-spot disease superspreading # Many diseases spread more readily in certain \u0026ldquo;hot-spot\u0026rdquo; locations, like bars and restaurants. Some people go more frequently to these hot-spots, which creates a risk structure in the population. This project investigates this particular risk structure, taking advantage of known patterns in human mobility.\nII. Emergent trail networks # When a person or animal walk through rough terrain, they flatten it down, making it easier for subsequent travelers to walk the same way. When multiple individuals walk between multiple destinations, this positive feedback leads to the emergence of a network of trails. This project investigates the topology, dynamics, stability and other properties of such emergent trail networks using a computational modeling approach.\nIII. Scales of Animal Mobility # I\u0026rsquo;m working to expand upon the approach taken in The scales of human mobility, to look for scales in animal mobility, and to investigate anthropological invariants.\nSelected publications # Althouse, B.M., Wallace, B., Case, B.K.M. et al.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the introduction to the first of them:\nThis is the first in a series of 5 \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; homework assignments that explore taylor series, the number $e$, imaginary numbers, and finally euler\u0026rsquo;s equation for $e^{i x}$. These ideas are some of the most beautiful and profound ones in all of mathematics; they run through and tie together everything else we do in calculus.\nThese assignments test a theory I have: that while we cordone some topics off as \u0026ldquo;too advanced\u0026rdquo;, they\u0026rsquo;re actually not that hard to start to learn with a gentle introduction; and they\u0026rsquo;re worth the effort. More practically, everyone comes to a class from a different starting place, and with a different learning style. These assignments give you an option to customize your experience: in exchange for doing a little more work you\u0026rsquo;ll learn more (and maybe in a way that works better for you), and you\u0026rsquo;ll have more control over your schedule and pacing for the quarter.\nIf you want to check them out they\u0026rsquo;re available here: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5\n","date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"/teaching/","section":"Teaching","summary":"Teaching experience # I\u0026rsquo;ve been a teaching assistant for math, computer science and ecology classes at Brown University and the University of Washington.\nQSCI 292 - Integral Calculus at UW in which I wrote the homework assignments, co-wrote exams, and delivered two weeks\u0026rsquo; lectures.","title":"Teaching"},{"content":"","date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"}]
